## Skills

#### Communication

- As an educator I was always preparing for the classroom.  I honed my writing and speaking skills in order to effectively reach my audience.  I have received much praise for my teaching and speaking abilities.  Even with my partners and teams at Makers Academy I sought to communicate with clarity and brevity, and also in a timely manner.

#### Work

- Self-motivated learner and I love to explore solutions using resources I find online and elsewhere.
- In my bootcamp group projects I worked hard to add value to the code.  In our "Life of Bernard" final project I researched how to use hooks and implement audio into the game.

## Hobbies

- **Sports, particularly basketball**  I enjoy playing.  Also I am an avid fan of the NBA.  I love watching my favourite teams and tracking their statistics.  It is interesting to compare statistics (the numbers) and the "eye-test" (what my instincts tell me about certain players and teams).
- **Playing PC/video games**   I try to keep up-to-date with news about games and the new tech that emerges.
- **TV/movies**   Enjoy a good story.
- **Travel** I have been to many countries and I enjoy learning about various cultures.
