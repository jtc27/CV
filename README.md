Happy New Year!** 

**Who am I?** Hi I'm Jacob, an American who arrived in the UK in Sept 2021 to study programming at Makers Academy.

**What did I do before coding?** I was a teacher for many years.  From 2015-2021 I taught in South Korea.  My subjects included ESL, Maths and Science.  I taught multiple age groups.  My most recent job was Professor of English at Joongbu University in Seoul, a post I held for two and a half years.

**Why did I decide to do coding?** At the start of 2021 I thought about a career change and got into coding through online resources.  I enjoyed it and envisioned myself doing it, which led me to study at Makers.

## Coding Skills

#### Communication

- After university, I worked with local churches in the Denver area.  I gave public speeches and taught classes to university groups and high school students.  I improved my speaking and writing skills.  I received many accolades and requests from local churches and even spoke at conferences in other cities.

#### Leadership

- My work with local churches and community groups gave me the opportunity to exercise many leadership skills.  I built successful networks with local friends and contacts.  We hosted summer camps for students, charity events, and local community outreaches.

#### Independent Learning

- In my work with churches I did not have many mentors or resources.  This led me to search out mentors, books, online resources and the like in order to maximise my abilities.

## Hobbies

- **Sports, particularly basketball**  I enjoy playing.  Also I am an avid fan of the NBA.  I love watching my favourite teams and tracking their statistics.  It is interesting to compare statistics (the numbers) and the "eye-test" (what my instincts tell me about certain players and teams).
- **Playing PC/video games**   I try to keep up-to-date with news about games and the new tech that emerges.
- **TV/movies**   Enjoy a good story.
- **Travel** I have been to many countries and I enjoy learning about various cultures.
